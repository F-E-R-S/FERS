# Road_Sign_Detection
Nokia colective project done during our second year at West University of TImisoara. The project will be mainly done in Python using deep learning APIs, machine learning tools and web frameworks.  


## Goal
Detect a road sign in a photo.

### Best case scenario
Detect a road sign in a photo AND in a video.

# Technolohies used:
- Python(mainly) including things like Keras, OpenCV, Tensorflow
- Django
- Database(maybe?) or at least a local dataset used for training
- and maybe more to be added

## Checklist of done things:
- Diagrams for database and whole project
- Excel for weekly tasks
- Mock-up GUI
- more will be added

## This week to do list:
- Getting familiar with Keras, Tensorflow
- Make a dataset
